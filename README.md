# 📊 Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

This project is an assignment that demonstrates **data analysis** using the `pandas` library and **data visualization** using the `matplotlib` library in Python.  

The goal is to:
- Load and explore a dataset
- Perform basic analysis
- Create simple visualizations
- Summarize key findings

---

## 🚀 Features
- Load dataset from CSV using `pandas`
- Explore data with `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`
- Handle missing values and check correlations
- Perform groupby and summary statistics
- Create visualizations:
  - Line chart (trend over time)
  - Bar chart (comparison across categories)
  - Histogram (distribution)
  - Scatter plot (relationships between variables)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- *(Optional: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis)*
